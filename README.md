# Crowdfunding_ETL

This project is aimed to get a better understanding of the ETL pipeline. In this project we built an ETL pipeline utilizing Python, Pandas, and Python dictionary methods to extract and transform the data. After this process, we created 4 CSV files, and used the CSV files to create an ERD and a table schema. The CSV files were then uploaded into a PostGres database.
